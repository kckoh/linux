# 1. Business Scenario
We are going to process Canadian Climate data.

Usually, when we want to download the weather data manually, we go to https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html.

But this time, you are going to use a data engineer way to download some data from Canada Climate website, and output one file.

# 2. Business Requirements
Please download the data from Canadian Climate.
Please concatenate the downloaded files into one final csv file, called all_years.csv. This is the output of the lab.
Please upload your scripts and final csv file all_years.csv to the repository you created in the Github.
# 3. Deliverable
You need to submit a shell script, a python script and all_years.csv to the github repository you created for the lab.

Shell script: You will use the shell script to control every operation, including data downloading, log setting, python script running.
Python script: While the Python script is used to concatenate all the data into one file.
all_years.csv: This is the output file you concatenate all the downloads.
# 4. Program Procedure
download data with shell command
concatenate data to one file with the python script
save output file in the python script
print out SUCCESS with shell command.
create a repository in github, and upload your file to the repo with git.
The Shell script will call the Python Script to finish the Python work.

# 5. Specification Detail
